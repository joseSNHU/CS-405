# CS-405

Throughout this project, I have learned that security must be integrated into every stage of the development process rather than treated as an afterthought. The idea of “Don’t leave security to the end” reinforces that vulnerabilities are easier and less costly to address when identified early. Building security into design, coding, and testing helps create a stronger foundation and reduces the risk of major issues later in the project. By continuously reviewing and validating code, developers can maintain transparency about risks and take proactive steps to prevent weaknesses before they become serious problems.

Adopting a secure coding standard supports this approach by providing consistent guidelines that promote safe programming practices. Following these standards helps prevent common attacks such as SQL injection or buffer overflow and ensures developers follow best practices for data validation, error handling, and access control. During my project, I focused on validating user inputs and writing tests that checked for incorrect or malicious values. These steps helped prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced and demonstrated how secure coding can naturally align with good development practices.

Evaluating risk and balancing the cost of mitigation are also key to effective security management. Not all risks carry the same weight, so it is important to assess both the likelihood of a threat and its potential impact. This helps prioritize which vulnerabilities need immediate attention and which can be addressed over time. By performing regular risk assessments, developers can make informed decisions about where to allocate resources for the greatest security benefit.

The concept of Zero Trust extends this proactive approach. Zero Trust operates on the idea of “never trust, always verify,” meaning that every user and device must continuously prove their legitimacy. Even within a trusted network, no one is automatically given full access. This approach enforces least privilege, limits exposure, and reduces the damage that could occur if credentials are compromised. Although it can feel restrictive for users who value convenience, Zero Trust provides essential protection for sensitive information and supports the broader goal of maintaining a secure environment.

Finally, implementing strong security policies ties all these ideas together. Policies set the expectations for how security should be handled across development and operations. They ensure that secure coding practices, risk assessments, and Zero Trust principles are consistently applied. Effective policies should also evolve as technologies and threats change, keeping teams aligned and accountable.
